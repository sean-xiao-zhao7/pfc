                        through Christ and gave us the ministry of
                        reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to
                        himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against
                        them. And he has committed to us the message of
                        reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors,
                        as though God were making his appeal through us. We
                        implore you on Christ‘s behalf: Be reconciled to God.”

                    Each one of us represents a complex story of how we’ve
                    become who we are today. Our stories include moments of joy,
                    pain, brilliance, and dysfunction – moments of delight and
                    deep disappointment. But Scripture instructs us that we are
                    not to be defined only by our worst or most painful moments
                    – whether self-inflicted or through others’ choices.

                            For those who have committed crimes for which they
                            are now incarcerated, the most difficult parts of
                            their story have resulted in devastating
                            consequences for others and for themselves. They are
                            unable to escape or ignore the results of their
                            worst decisions. Those who have been convicted of
                            crimes often serve their sentences for life, even
                            when and long after their incarceration ends.

                            It is clear that the journey to incarceration or
                            conviction is complex: generational trauma,
                            marginalization, self-hatred, addiction, and mental
                            illness are common to the experience of people who
                            commit crimes. These experiences do not excuse the
                            offence; they explain the journey to incarceration.

                            While we would say that we are so much more than the
                            consequences of our most harmful decisions, the same
                            needs to be said for the person living out the
                            consequences of their worst decisions within the
                            criminal justice system. The same grace and worth we
                            accept for ourselves we must extend to those whose
                            choices are criminalized – this is loving our
                            neighbour as ourselves. In doing this, we
                            acknowledge that all have sinned and fallen short,
                            and we all have the potential for redemption,
                            transformation and growth.

                            We know this is possible because we believe in a God
                            who made us all in His image – who provided hope for
                            forgiveness in the form of the Son of Man, Jesus
                            Christ. A God who restores and reconciles us to Him,
                            while calling us to be ambassadors of
                            reconciliation.

                    Prison Fellowship Canada’s mandate is to meet people who
                    have committed crimes or who are impacted by crime –
                    families of prisoners or victims of crime – wherever they
                    are in their journey, to facilitate reconciliation and the
                    freedom that it brings.

                    Our role is to help create the conditions where the story of
                    the Prodigal Son is possible for every prisoner. A true
                    story where the prisoner has the opportunity to be welcomed
                    back, to be part of a story of restoration and
                    transformation for them and all impacted by their decisions.

                            Our ultimate goal is to facilitate the
                            transformation of lives – prisoners, families and
                            victims – so that they all can experience spiritual

                            others and themselves. This type of transformation
                            is enabled by our partnerships with the government,
                            Corrections staff, and the Canadian Christian
                            community.

                    Christian church to play a meaningful role in a
                    transformational response to crime, supporting victims of
