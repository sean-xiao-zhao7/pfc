                    Prison Fellowship Canada began working with the program in
                    2015 and has recently revised the program to include
                    responses to what we have learned through the work with many
                    offenders, victims, and chaplains who gather with us in an
                    effort to contribute to Shalom â€“ nothing less than all of
                    creation healed.

                        <p>
                            The program takes its name from the story of
                            Zacchaeus and his encounter with Jesus (Luke 19:1-
                            10).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Program participants explore the effects of crime on
                            victims, offenders, and the community. Prisoners
                            come to the understanding of the harm that crime
                            causes both to victims and the community. Victims
                            begin to understand the humanity and brokenness of
                            prisoners and begin to reflect on their own
                            experience in a way that assists their healing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Offenders confront, often for the first time both
                            their own issues that led to crime and the effects
                            and impact of the harms they have caused others. The
                            program works because it offers a safe,
                            non-judgmental space to explore the hard issues, it
                            allows for offenders and victims to share their
                            stories which is often the beginning of their
                            healing and reflective exercises throughout allow
                            participants to make life changes that result in
                            active responsibility with on-going accountability.
