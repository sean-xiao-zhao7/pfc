                    Prison Fellowship Canada understands that the complete
                    journey of reconciliation and restoration for prisoners and
                    ex-prisoners critically includes supporting their families,
                    particularly their children. PFCâ€™s Angel Tree program
                    partners with churches, individuals and the community to
                    provide opportunities for children to feel connected to
                    their parents and help them develop their unique skills and
                    gifts.
