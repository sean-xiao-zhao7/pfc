                            There are over 357,000 children affected by parental
                            incarceration in Canada. These children often carry
                            the weight of shame and the stigmatization of their
                            peers. At PFC we recognize the importance of the
                            healing journey of the family of those who are
                            incarcerated. The Angel Tree program offers a number
                            of programs that help children know they are loved.
