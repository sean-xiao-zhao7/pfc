                    We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of
                    heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.
                    <br />
                    We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God,
                    eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from
                    Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one
                    Being with the Father; through Him, all things were made.
                    <br />
                    For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven, was
                    incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became
                    truly human.
                    <br />
                    For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he
                    suffered death and was buried.
                    <br />
                    On the third day, he rose again in accordance with the
                    Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the
                    right hand of the Father.
                    <br />
                    He will come again in glory to judge the living and the
                    dead, and his kingdom will have no end.
                    <br />
                    We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
                    who proceeds from the Father [and the Son], who with the
                    Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified, who has
                    spoken through the prophets.
                    <br />
                    We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We
                    acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
                    <br />
                    We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of
                    the world to come.

                    We believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was
                    conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He
                    suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was
                    buried; he descended to hell. The third day he rose again
                    from the dead. He ascended to heaven and is seated at the
                    right hand of God the Father Almighty. From there He will
                    come to judge the living and the dead.
                    <br />
                    We believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the
                    communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the
                    resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
