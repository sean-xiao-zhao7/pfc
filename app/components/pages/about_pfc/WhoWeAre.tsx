                    Prison Fellowship Canada’s mandate is to meet people who
                    have committed crimes or who are impacted by crime –
                    families of prisoners or victims of crime – wherever they
                    are in their journey, to facilitate reconciliation and the
                    freedom that it brings.

                    Finding himself in prison after holding a prominent
                    political role, Chuck Colson experienced the transformation
                    that only the Gospel can provide. He says, “I found myself
                    increasingly drawn to the idea that God had put me in prison
                    for a purpose and that I should do something for those I had
                    left behind”. From there, an important and life- changing
                    ministry was born.
