                    Prison Fellowship Canada (PFC) executes its vision through
                    people, including our growing network of PFC Volunteers
                    across Canada. Our volunteers serve by working with children
                    and families, offenders, ex-offenders, victims, or through
                    fundraising, donations, prayer and office support. There are
                    many entry points and ways to be involved â€“ and we are
                    respectful of your comfort level.
