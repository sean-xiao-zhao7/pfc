                            There are over 357,000 children affected by parental
                            incarceration in Canada. These children often carry
                            the weight of shame and the stigmatization of their
                            peers. PFCâ€™s Angel Tree Christmas program connects
                            church communities and individuals with the families
                            of prisoners through the delivery of a Christmas
                            gift on behalf of the incarcerated parent.
